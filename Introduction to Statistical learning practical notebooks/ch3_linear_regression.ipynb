    "Simple linear regression lives up to its name: it is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of a single predictor variable X. It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between X and Y. Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as: \n",
    "Y ≈ β0 + β1X\n",
    "\n",
    "where β0 and β1 are two unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope, also known as coefficients or parameters. Once we have used our training data to produce estimates b0 and b1 for the model coefficients, we can predict future values of Y by plugging in the X values of the new data points.  "

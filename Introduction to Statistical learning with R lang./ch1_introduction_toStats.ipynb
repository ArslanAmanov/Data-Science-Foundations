    "# Statistical Learning  \n",
    "Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business,medicine,astrophysics,and public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless, we can learn relationships and structure from such data. Unsupervised learning problems can also be found in a wide range of fields.... "
